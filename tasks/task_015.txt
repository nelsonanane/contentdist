# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard with various data scenarios. Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes. Test filtering and date range selection. Ensure data visualizations render correctly with different metrics. Test accessibility using automated tools and manual testing. Verify performance meets requirements with large data sets. Test error states and loading indicators. Verify real-time updates from Supabase work correctly.
