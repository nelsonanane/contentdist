# Task ID: 9
# Title: OpenAI API Integration for Content Conversion
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement backend services to convert content for different platforms using OpenAI's API with caching and rate limiting.
# Details:
Set up OpenAI API client with proper authentication. Create service for generating platform-specific content versions. Implement prompt engineering based on platform requirements and brand settings. Handle API rate limiting and error scenarios with graceful fallbacks. Create caching mechanism using Supabase for API responses to reduce costs and improve performance. Implement logging for API usage and performance monitoring. Add comprehensive error handling with appropriate error messages and recovery strategies. Implement role-based access control using Supabase RLS policies to ensure only authorized users can access AI features based on subscription tier. Set up monitoring for API usage and costs.

# Test Strategy:
Test API integration with sample content. Verify prompt construction with different brand settings. Test error handling with simulated API failures. Measure and optimize response times and token usage. Verify caching in Supabase reduces API calls for similar content. Test rate limiting functionality. Verify Supabase RLS policies work correctly for access control.
