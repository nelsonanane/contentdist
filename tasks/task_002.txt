# Details:
Create Supabase project with appropriate region selection. Configure tables for users, brand_settings, projects, content_posts, schedules, and subscriptions. Implement proper relationships between tables with foreign keys. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control. Include indexes for frequently queried fields. Design schema to support the subscription tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise) and post limits. Implement specific Supabase features like JSON/JSONB for flexible data storage, array types for tags, and full-text search capabilities. Include GDPR/CCPA compliance fields for user consent tracking and data deletion requests. Implement database-level constraints to ensure data integrity. Configure Supabase real-time functionality for collaborative features. Set up proper indexing strategy to support 2s page load requirement.

# Test Strategy:
Verify table creation and schema setup. Write and execute test queries to validate relationships and constraints. Ensure all required fields from the PRD are represented in the schema. Test query performance with realistic data volumes. Verify GDPR/CCPA related fields function correctly. Test real-time functionality with multiple clients.
