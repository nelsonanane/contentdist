# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Base Structure
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with NextJS frontend and Supabase backend structure. Configure basic project settings, dependencies, and CI/CD pipeline.
# Details:
Create a monorepo structure with client (NextJS) and server folders. Initialize package.json in both directories. Set up ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configurations. Install core dependencies including NextJS, and Supabase client. Configure HeroUI and Tailwind CSS for UI components. Set up environment variables structure for different environments. Implement CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar tool for automated testing and deployment. Configure performance monitoring to ensure 2s page load requirement is met.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully. Ensure development server starts without errors. Validate ESLint and TypeScript configurations work correctly. Test CI/CD pipeline with sample commits. Verify HeroUI/Tailwind components render correctly.

# Subtasks:

```
## Updated Implementation Approach

Instead of a traditional monorepo with separate client and server directories, we'll leverage Next.js 14's built-in server components and API routes for a more efficient architecture:

### Project Initialization
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --eslint --tailwind --app --src-dir
```

### Project Structure
```
/src
  /app             # App Router pages with server components
    /api           # API routes (replaces separate server)
  /components      # Client and server components
  /lib             # Shared utilities and business logic
  /types           # TypeScript type definitions
  /hooks           # Custom React hooks
  /styles          # Global styles and theme configuration
/public            # Static assets
```

### TypeScript Configuration
Add to tsconfig.json:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "@components/*": ["./src/components/*"],
      "@lib/*": ["./src/lib/*"],
      "@hooks/*": ["./src/hooks/*"],
      "@types/*": ["./src/types/*"]
    },
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "next"
      }
    ],
    "strict": true
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ".next/types/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

### Server-Side Logic
- Use server components (`.tsx` files in app/ directory) for server-rendered UI
- Create API routes in `app/api` directory for data operations
- Use server actions for form submissions and mutations

### Benefits
- Simplified deployment (single application)
- Reduced bundle size with server components
- Improved type safety across client/server boundary
- Better developer experience with unified codebase

## Implementation Progress Update

### Completed Steps
- Project structure created with all required directories (app, components, lib, types, hooks, styles)
- Package.json initialized with the following key dependencies:
  ```json
  {
    "dependencies": {
      "next": "14.1.0",
      "react": "^18.2.0",
      "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
      "typescript": "^5.3.3",
      "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1",
      "postcss": "^8.4.35",
      "autoprefixer": "^10.4.17"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "@types/node": "^20.11.5",
      "@types/react": "^18.2.48",
      "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.18",
      "eslint": "^8.56.0",
      "eslint-config-next": "14.1.0"
    }
  }
  ```
- Tailwind CSS configured with custom theme settings in `tailwind.config.js`
- Basic app structure implemented with:
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` (RootLayout with metadata)
  - `src/app/page.tsx` (Home page with server component)
  - `src/app/api/health/route.ts` (Health check API endpoint)

### Current Issues
- ESLint showing 3 warnings related to unused variables
- Tailwind purge configuration needs optimization for production

### Next Steps Details
1. Test development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Verify at http://localhost:3000 and API at http://localhost:3000/api/health
   ```

2. Fix linter errors:
   ```bash
   npm run lint -- --fix
   ```

3. Add comprehensive `.gitignore`:
   ```
   # dependencies
   /node_modules
   /.pnp
   .pnp.js

   # testing
   /coverage

   # next.js
   /.next/
   /out/

   # production
   /build

   # misc
   .DS_Store
   *.pem

   # debug
   npm-debug.log*
   yarn-debug.log*
   yarn-error.log*

   # local env files
   .env*.local
   .env

   # vercel
   .vercel

   # typescript
   *.tsbuildinfo
   next-env.d.ts
   ```

4. README.md should include development commands, environment setup, and architecture overview
