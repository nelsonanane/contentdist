# Task ID: 3
# Title: Supabase Authentication Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user registration, login, and password recovery using Supabase Auth with both email/password and social login options, including GDPR compliance and role-based access control.
# Details:
Configure Supabase Auth settings for email/password authentication. Set up OAuth providers for Google and Facebook login options. Configure email templates for verification and password recovery. Implement client-side authentication flows using Supabase Auth SDK. Create custom user metadata fields for additional user information. Add GDPR/CCPA compliance features including consent tracking, privacy policy acceptance, and data export/deletion capabilities. Configure role-based access control using Supabase RLS policies with user roles (admin, standard user) and appropriate permission checks. Set up rate limiting for authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks. Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages and detailed logging.

# Test Strategy:
Test registration flow with valid and invalid inputs. Verify login with correct and incorrect credentials. Test password reset functionality. Validate social login flows with test accounts. Test GDPR consent flows and data export/deletion. Verify rate limiting prevents excessive login attempts. Test role-based access restrictions using RLS policies.
