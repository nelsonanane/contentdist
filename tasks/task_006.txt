Build image upload component with preview functionality using Supabase Storage. Design color picker component for brand colors. Create form for brand voice settings (formal, casual, etc.). Implement save and update functionality with proper error handling and user feedback. Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Follow UI/UX guidelines from section 6 of the PRD for consistent styling, component design, and interaction patterns using HeroUI and Tailwind CSS.

Test file upload with various image types and sizes to Supabase Storage. Verify color picker functionality. Test form submission and validation. Ensure changes persist after page refresh. Test accessibility using automated tools and manual testing. Verify performance meets requirements. Test error states and loading indicators.
