# Task ID: 5
# Title: Brand Settings Backend Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create API endpoints for managing brand assets, color schemes, and stylistic preferences with proper caching and error handling using Supabase.
# Details:
Implement CRUD operations for brand settings using Supabase client. Create endpoints for uploading and managing brand assets (logos, images). Develop controllers for storing color schemes and tone preferences. Set up Supabase Storage for brand assets with appropriate bucket configuration. Implement validation for uploaded files (size limits, file types). Configure Supabase tables and relationships for brand settings. Add role-based access control using Supabase RLS policies to ensure only authorized users can modify brand settings. Implement caching mechanism for brand assets to improve performance. Add comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints. Set up logging for all brand settings operations for audit purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Test API endpoints with valid and invalid requests. Verify file uploads work correctly with Supabase Storage. Ensure proper validation of inputs. Test retrieval of brand settings for authenticated users. Verify caching improves performance. Test rate limiting functionality. Verify RLS policies prevent unauthorized modifications.
