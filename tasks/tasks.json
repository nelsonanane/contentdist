Test development server:\n   ```bash\n   npm run dev\n   # Verify at http://localhost:3000 and API at http://localhost:3000/api/health\n   ```\n\n2. Fix linter errors:\n   ```bash\n   npm run lint -- --fix\n   ```\n\n3. Add comprehensive `.gitignore`:\n   ```\n   # dependencies\n   /node_modules\n   /.pnp\n   .pnp.js\n\n   # testing\n   /coverage\n\n   # next.js\n   /.next/\n   /out/\n\n   # production\n   /build\n\n   # misc\n   .DS_Store\n   *.pem\n\n   # debug\n   npm-debug.log*\n   yarn-debug.log*\n   yarn-error.log*\n\n   # local env files\n   .env*.local\n   .env\n\n   # vercel\n   .vercel\n\n   # typescript\n   *.tsbuildinfo\n   next-env.d.ts\n   ```\n\n4.
