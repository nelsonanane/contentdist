# Task ID: 20
# Title: System Testing and Deployment Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 11, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing, monitoring, and set up deployment pipeline for the application with performance optimization.
# Details:
Set up testing framework for frontend (Jest, React Testing Library) and backend (Mocha, Chai). Implement unit tests for critical components and services. Create integration tests for API endpoints and user flows. Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar tool. Configure staging and production environments with separate Supabase projects. Implement database migration process for Supabase schema changes. Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging with tools like Sentry and Datadog for error tracking, performance monitoring, and user behavior analytics. Create documentation for deployment and maintenance procedures. Implement performance testing to ensure 2s page load requirement is met. Set up accessibility testing in the CI pipeline. Add security scanning for vulnerabilities. Implement load testing to verify system performance under expected user load.

# Test Strategy:
Run comprehensive test suite covering all major functionality. Verify CI/CD pipeline correctly builds and deploys the application. Test deployment to staging environment with Supabase. Ensure monitoring tools are correctly capturing errors and performance metrics. Verify performance meets requirements under various load conditions. Test accessibility compliance across the application. Verify security scanning identifies potential vulnerabilities.
