# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build accessible interface for posting content immediately or scheduling for future dates following UI/UX guidelines.
# Details:
Create posting interface with platform selection options. Implement date/time picker for scheduling posts. Build calendar view for visualizing scheduled content. Add confirmation dialogs for post actions. Implement status indicators for posts (draft, scheduled, posted, failed) with real-time updates using Supabase. Create edit and delete functionality for scheduled posts. Design notification system for post status updates. Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Follow UI/UX guidelines from section 6 of the PRD for consistent styling, component design, and interaction patterns using HeroUI and Tailwind CSS.

# Test Strategy:
Test immediate posting and scheduling functionality. Verify calendar view displays correct information. Test edit and delete operations on scheduled posts. Ensure notifications appear for status changes using Supabase real-time features. Test accessibility using automated tools and manual testing. Verify performance meets requirements. Test error states and recovery options.
