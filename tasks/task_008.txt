# Task ID: 8
# Title: Content Creation UI Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the accessible content creation interface with Tiptap editor and platform-specific previews following UI/UX guidelines.
# Details:
Create a content creation page with Tiptap editor integration. Implement platform selection UI (checkboxes/toggles for target platforms). Build preview components for different platforms (Facebook, X, Instagram, LinkedIn). Add media upload functionality with size validation (10MB limit for images) using Supabase Storage. Implement draft saving and loading with error handling and recovery options using Supabase real-time features. Create UI for content metadata (title, description, tags). Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Follow UI/UX guidelines from section 6 of the PRD for consistent styling, component design, and interaction patterns using HeroUI and Tailwind CSS. Implement performance optimizations to meet 2s page load requirement. Add clear error states and loading indicators for all asynchronous operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test content creation with various types of content (text, images, mixed). Verify platform previews render correctly. Test draft saving and loading functionality with Supabase. Ensure media uploads work with valid and invalid files to Supabase Storage. Test accessibility using automated tools and manual testing. Verify performance meets requirements. Test error states and loading indicators.
