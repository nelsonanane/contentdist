# Description: Implement analytics dashboard with metrics from Ayrshare API and internal data with performance optimization and caching.
# Details:
Create service to fetch analytics data from Ayrshare API. Implement caching for analytics data in Supabase to improve performance and meet 2s page load requirement. Build data aggregation for platform-specific and overall metrics. Create Supabase tables for storing historical analytics data. Implement scheduled jobs to update analytics regularly. Design API endpoints to serve dashboard data efficiently. Add role-based access control for analytics data using Supabase RLS policies based on user permissions. Implement comprehensive error handling for API failures with fallback to cached data. Set up monitoring for analytics data freshness and API performance. Configure Supabase real-time features for live analytics updates.

# Test Strategy:
Test data fetching from Ayrshare API. Verify metrics calculations are accurate. Test caching mechanism effectiveness in Supabase. Ensure analytics update on schedule. Test performance with large data sets. Verify Supabase RLS policies for access control. Test fallback mechanisms during API failures. Verify real-time updates work correctly.
