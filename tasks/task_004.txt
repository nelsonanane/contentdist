# Title: Authentication UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create accessible frontend components for user registration, login, and password recovery with GDPR compliance features.
# Details:
Build NextJS components for login, registration, and password recovery forms. Implement form validation using a library like Formik or React Hook Form. Create UI for social login buttons. Design responsive layouts for authentication screens using HeroUI and Tailwind CSS. Implement client-side validation and error handling with clear user feedback. Set up authentication state management using Supabase Auth hooks and Context API or Redux. Add GDPR/CCPA compliance UI elements including consent checkboxes, privacy policy links, and data management options. Ensure all forms meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards with proper labels, focus states, and keyboard navigation. Implement performance optimizations to meet 2s page load requirement. Follow UI/UX guidelines from section 6 of the PRD for consistent styling, typography, and component design.

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation with various input scenarios. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes. Test error message display for invalid inputs. Ensure accessibility compliance using automated tools (Lighthouse, axe) and manual testing. Verify GDPR consent UI functions correctly. Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
