# Description: Implement Stripe API integration for handling payments and subscriptions with GDPR compliance and comprehensive error handling.

Set up Stripe API client with proper authentication. Implement subscription plan creation in Stripe dashboard. Create checkout sessions for subscription sign-ups. Handle webhook events for subscription lifecycle (created, updated, canceled). Implement upgrade/downgrade functionality with prorated billing. Create Supabase tables for tracking subscription status. Implement receipt generation and email delivery. Add GDPR/CCPA compliance features for payment data handling and retention policies. Implement comprehensive error handling for payment failures with user-friendly messages. Set up logging and monitoring for payment-related events.

# Test Strategy:
Test subscription creation with test cards. Verify webhook handling for various events. Test upgrade and downgrade flows. Ensure proper error handling for payment failures. Verify GDPR compliance features work correctly. Test receipt generation and delivery. Verify logging captures relevant payment events. Test Supabase RLS policies for subscription-based access control.
