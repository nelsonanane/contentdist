# Revised Integration Plan: Step-by-Step Implementation

You're right, breaking this down into smaller, testable steps will make the implementation more manageable. And we'll use GPT-4.1 instead of DALL-E for image generation. Here's a step-by-step approach:

## Phase 1: Database Setup and Basic UI

### Step 1: Supabase Table Creation

1. Create `content_generator_jobs` table in Supabase
2. Set up RLS policies for the table
3. Test with simple queries to ensure permissions work correctly

### Step 2: Basic Form UI

1. Create dashboard navigation link to the content generator
2. Create the basic `CharacterForm` component with just character type selection
3. Implement routing to the new page
4. Test navigation and basic rendering

## Phase 2: Form Development and API Routes

### Step 3: Complete Dynamic Form

1. Add conditional form fields based on character type selection
2. Implement form validation
3. Add submission handling
4. Test form state management and validation

### Step 4: Form Submission API

1. Create basic API route for form submission
2. Implement database entry creation
3. Add user authentication check
4. Test submission flow and database entry

## Phase 3: Content Generation - Script

### Step 5: OpenAI Integration for Script Generation

1. Set up OpenAI client in `lib` directory
2. Create character-specific prompt templates
3. Implement script generation API route
4. Test with different character types and topics

### Step 6: Script Status Updating

1. Create job status API route
2. Implement status updating in script generation process
3. Create basic results page with status display
4. Test status updates and display

## Phase 4: Content Generation - Audio and Video

### Step 7: Eleven Labs Integration

1. Set up Eleven Labs client
2. Implement audio generation API route
3. Configure voice selection based on character type
4. Test audio generation and storage

### Step 8: Hedra Integration

1. Set up Hedra client
2. Implement video generation API route
3. Configure proper parameters based on character type
4. Test video generation and storage

## Phase 5: User Experience and Polish

### Step 9: Results Page Enhancement

1. Improve results UI with proper loading states
2. Add playback controls for audio/video
3. Implement retry mechanisms for failed jobs
4. Test full user flow with error scenarios

### Step 10: Dashboard Integration

1. Add content generator history to dashboard
2. Implement content listing and filtering
3. Add sharing and export options
4. Final end-to-end testing

# Implementation Steps for Immediate Focus

Let's start with Phase 1, which we can implement and test immediately:

### First, let's create the Supabase table:

1. Write the SQL migration for the `content_generator_jobs` table
2. Set up RLS policies to ensure proper access control
3. Test with basic queries

### Then, implement the basic UI:

1. Create the dashboard navigation link
2. Set up the initial form component
3. Create the routes and basic page structure
4. Test navigation flow
